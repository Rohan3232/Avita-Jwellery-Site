                        <p>Conversations with hundreds of women across the country revealed a common problem: buying expensive jewellery for momentous events & settling for mediocre designs that failed to keep up with their dynamic lifestyles.
                            CaratLane was founded in 2008 to bridge the gap between exquisite jewellery meant for special occasions and everyday wear, making diamond jewellery accessible, affordable, and a timeless part of your life that you could wear effortlessly every day.
                            Today, CaratLane stands as India's largest omni-channel jeweller, with a robust presence in more than 100 Indian cities through an extensive network of over 250 retail stores.
